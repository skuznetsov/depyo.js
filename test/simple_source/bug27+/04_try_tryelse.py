# From 2.7 test_normalize.py
# Bug has to do with finding the end of the tryelse block. I think thrown
# off by the "continue". In instructions the COME_FROM for END_FINALLY
# was at the wrong offset because some sort of "rtarget" was adjust.

# When control flow is in place this logic in the code will be simplified
