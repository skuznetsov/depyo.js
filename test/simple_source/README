Files in this directory contain very simple constructs.
Some of these don't work across across all versions of Python.

Their simplicity is to try to make it easier to debug scanner, grammar
and semantic-action routines.

The numbers in the filenames are to assist running the programs from
the simplest to more complex. For example, many tests have assignment
statements or function calls, so we want to test those constructs
first.
